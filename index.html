    <p>We provide quality out of school hour's childcare for children aged 3 to 12 years. The club aims to meet the needs of all children with parents whose working/training schedule causes problems with childcare. We do operate an equal opportunity policy, and all children will be able to use the setting to have fun and play with their friends.

Extra Time is a registered childcare facility under the Children Act 89 & undergoes an annual inspection to assess quality. 

The provision holds & operates all relevant policies & procedures to ensure standards are met, inclusive of equal opportunities and specific needs. These are available on request. 

We are committed to an ongoing review of the quality of care & regularly update parents through information letters.

We welcome comments & suggestions from both parents & children.
